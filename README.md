# Better Hacker News
A modern approach to the Hacker News webpage. You can find the API [here](https://github.com/TolisSth/BetterHackerNews-back-end) 
# Set up & run 
After setting up the API as described in the API's page you can go ahead and run the following: 
- `npm install` to install all dependencies needed
- `npm run dev` for dev server

As this project continues, I'll upload instructions for production.
